### About
This is a simple application that demonstrates the use of media queries with HTML and CSS. It's about a music festival that describes when and where the event takes places, what it looks like with pictures and also has a video introduction.

#### Media Queries
Media Queries lets you add breakpoints to in your css file that helps make your page responsive. 

An example is: 
```
@media only screen and (max-width: 800px) {
    ul {
        display: inline-block;
        width: 400px;
    }
}

```
