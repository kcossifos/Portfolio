#About
This github repo is a representation of work that I have completed throughout my time at Full Sail University while studying Web Design and Development. Throughout this repo you will see numerous coding languages I have learned such as Javascript, PHP, Angular, HTML, CSS, along with varous others. In addition, you will come across work that I have created in Creative Adobe Suite like Illustrator and Photoshop. This course has not only taught me how to design and code but also to use databases. I will include explanations of my code along with snippets and sql dumps.
