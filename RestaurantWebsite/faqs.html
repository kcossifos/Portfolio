			<p><b>What is vegan food?</b> A vegan diet excludes all animal products, comprising vegetables, vegetable oils, grains, legumes, nuts, fruits and seeds. Meat, eggs, dairy products, and other animal derivatives are not consumed.</p>

			<p><b>Do you accept take-out orders?</b> Yes, we do! You can place a take-out order by calling the restaurant at 407-228-3898. Our friendly staff will be happy to let you know about today's specials. </p>

			<p><b>Do you serve alcohol?</b> Yes, we offer a small selection of beer and wine. Did you know that not all alcoholic beverages are vegan? Well, don't worry, we've verified that each of our selections are vegan - free of isinglass, chitosan, albumen, and other animal by-products. Please note: in accordance with local ordinance, BYOB is not acceptable at our restaurant.</p>

			<p><b>Do you accept reservations?</b> No, we are a first-come, first-serve establishment, and reservations are not accepted. Exception: We accept courtesy reservations for parties consisting of eight guests or more. While reservations are not required, we recommend that parties of this size make a reservation during peak meal times: Friday and Saturday dinner, and Sunday Brunch. Please call us at 407-228-3898 to request a reservation.</p>
			
			<p><b>Do you deliver?</b> Currently we do not offer delivery service. However, we may introduce delivery service to a limited area at some point in the future.</p>
			
			<p><b>Do you have nutritional information or calorie counts for your menu?</b> We do not have formal nutritional workups for our menu items. Because we make nearly everything from scratch, it is not as simple as reading the label. And, unfortunately, hiring a nutritionist to conduct the analyses has so far been out of reach of our budget. For a rough idea, we suggest looking up a similar food item on a nutritional value website such as CalorieCount.com - the figures won't be exact, but the ballpark should be about the same.<p>
