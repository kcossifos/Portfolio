				<h3 class="names">Sailor Moon</h3><!--Information on Sailor Moon-->
			
				<p class="right"><em>Usagi Tsukino</em> (<abbr title="Usagi Tsukino">UT</abbr>, called Serena Tsukino in the original English dub) is the main protagonist of the series and leader of the Sailor Soldiers. Usagi is a careless young girl with an enormous capacity for love, compassion, and understanding. Usagi transforms into the heroine called Sailor Moon, Soldier of Love and Justice. At the beginning of the series, she is fourteen years old and portrayed as an immature crybaby who resents fighting evil and wants nothing more than to be a normal girl. As she progresses, however, she embraces the chance to use her power to protect those she cares about.</p>

				<h3 class="names">Sailor Mercury</h3><!--Information on Sailor Mercury-->
		
				<p class="right"><em>Ami Mizuno</em> (<abbr title="Ami Mizuno">AM</abbr>, called Amy Mizuno in the original English dub) is the second Sailor Soldier to be introduced in the series. Ami is a quiet but intelligent fourteen-year-old bookworm in Usagi's class with a rumored IQ of 300, she can transform into Sailor Mercury, Soldier of Water and Wisdom. Ami's shy exterior masks a passion for knowledge and taking care of the people around her. She hopes to become a doctor one day, like her mother, and tends to be the practical one in the group. Secretly, she is also a fan of pop culture and romance novels, and becomes embarrassed whenever this is pointed out. Ami would also be considered the "tech girl" and the "brain" of the group by using her mini data computer, which is capable of scanning and detecting virtually anything she needs.</p>

				<h3 class="names">Sailor Mars</h3><!--Information on Sailor Mars-->
			
				<p class="right"><em>Rei Hino</em> (<abbr title="Rei Hino">RH</abbr>, called Raye Hino in the original English dub) is the third Sailor Soldier to be introduced. Rei is an elegant, fourteen-year-old miko (shrine maiden). Because of her work as a Shinto priestess, Rei has limited precognition and can dispel/nullify evil using special Shinto scrolls, even in her civilian form.[ She transforms into Sailor Mars, Soldier of Fire and Passion. She is very serious and focused, and she easily gets annoyed by Usagi's laziness, although she cares about her very much. Rei is portrayed as boy-crazy in the anime adaptation and short-tempered throughout, but is uninterested in romance and self-controlled in both the manga and live-action series. She attends a private, Catholic school separate from the other girls.</p>

				<h3 class="names">Sailor Jupiter</h3><!--Information on Sailor Jupiter-->
		
				<p class="right"><em>Makoto Kino</em> (<abbr title="Kino Makoto">KM</abbr>, called Lita Kino in the original English dub) is the fourth Sailor Soldier to be introduced. Makoto is a fourteen-year-old tomboy who is a student in Usagi Tsukino's class and has immense physical strength and in fact was rumoured to have been kicked out of her previous school for fighting. Unusually tall and strong for a Japanese schoolgirl, she transforms into Sailor Jupiter, Soldier of Thunder and Strength. Both Makoto's parents died in a plane crash years ago, so she lives alone and takes care of herself. She cultivates her physical strength as well as more domestic interests, including housekeeping, cooking, and gardening. Makoto is also good at hand-to-hand combat. She wants to marry young and to own a flower-and-cake shop.</p>

				<h3 class="names">Sailor Venus</h3><!--Information on Sailor Venus-->
			
				<p class="right"><em>Minako Aino</em> (<abbr title="Aino Minako">AM</abbr>, called Mina Aino in the original English dub) is the fifth Sailor Soldier to be introduced. A fourteen-year-old perky dreamer, Minako first appears as the main protagonist of Codename: Sailor V. She has a companion cat called Artemis who works alongside Luna in guiding the Sailor Soldiers. Minako transforms into Sailor Venus, Soldier of Love and Beauty, and leads Sailor Moon's four inner soldiers, while acting as Sailor Moon's closest bodyguard-decoy because of their near-identical looks. She also dreams of becoming a famous singer and idol; she attends auditions whenever she can. In contrast, in the live-action series, she is a successful J-Pop singer (of whom Usagi, Ami, and Makoto are fans) and has a poor health condition (due to anemia), choosing to separate herself from the other Guardians as a result.</p>
